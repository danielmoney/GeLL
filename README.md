GeLL is a General Likelihood Library for use in phylogenetics. It is intended to provide classes that facilitate investigating new models and techniques. It is not intended for everyday use in phylogenetic studies as it is optimised for easy use of new models rather than speed.

GeLL achieves this versatility by allowing models to be defined using an array of Strings where each string represents an equation. This allows new models to be defined quickly and easily. The driver executable included allows many different models to be run simply by changing the text file defining the model.

This git repository contains the latest developmental, but stable, version of GeLL.  Although it is stable it may not be fully documented and may contain features that do not make it into the next release.
